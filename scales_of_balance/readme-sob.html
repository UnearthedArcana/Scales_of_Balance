  <p><strong> Version 6.0 </strong><br />
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, Linux (...?)</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is all about improving gameplay.  While I love mods that bring the game closer to PnP, like Rogue Rebalancing and aTweaks, BG is a single-player computer game.  If tweaking a rule makes this specific game more fun, then it's a good tweak, PnP be damned.  Consider this mod as a collection of 'house rules' specific to the BG campaign. Every choice has been made with an eye to the particular gameplay mechanics of BG2 and the EEs.</p>
  <p>I call this a "post-hac tweak mod" because it is designed to be installed on top of - not instead of - all the other great mods out there.  I began with a BGT game with over 75 mods; they made the game great, but a few things still irked me, like awkwardly fourth-wall-breaking weapon names. (<i>Holy sword +6? Really? That's a punchline, not a game feature.</i>) </p>
  <p><strong><u>Everything is completely optional.  You can use as many or as few of the mod components as you want.  There is no 'core' component; use what you like, ignore what you don't.</u></strong> </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have an "SoB" folder and "setup-SoB.exe" in your BG2 folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-SoB.exe" and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-SoB.exe in your BG2 folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a folder called "Scales_of_Balance" and the "WeiDU Mac Launcher" app in your BG2 directory. To install, simply double-click the WeiDU Launcher, choose Scales of Balance from the list, and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Scales of Balance is designed to work with any Infinity Engine game on a variant of the BG2 engine that someone might purchase and play today, in 2014. At the moment, that includes TOB, TuTu, BGT, BG:EE, BG2:EE, and IWD:EE.</p>
  <p>Scales of Balance aims to be compatible with almost all other popular mods. There are however a few compatibility issues of note:<br />
  <ul>
  	<li>Some of the tweaks here cover the same ground as other tweak mods. This should hopefully be pretty obvious: for example, my hit dice component and the changes to level-up hit dice in Tweaks Anthology; my Weapon Proficiency Overhaul and the Tweaks' proficiency changes; my changes to stat bonuses and various other mods' changes to stat bonuses... etc. These kinds of overlaps should be pretty obvious.</li><br />
  	<li>I have not tested compatibility with Kit Revisions. These two mods cover a lot of the same ground.  For now at least, you should probably choose one or the other.</li><br />
  	<li>The first component of <u>Rogue Rebalancing</u> is not compatible, and not necessary, with SoB's component #122 "the Weapon Proficiency Overall Overhaul." </li><br />
  	<li>Most of SoB's overhauls and class tweaks are incompatible with the first, "core" component of <u>Six's Kitpack</u>. Take a look at what each mod does and decide which one you want to use.</li><br />
  </ul></p>
  <p>See the component descriptions below for more specific information about compatibility.</p>
  <p><strong>Load Order:</strong><br />
    Scales of Balance should be installed <strong>after</strong> all other mods that add or change creatures, items, spells, and kits.  It should be installed after most tweak mods, like Tweaks Anthology.  Most of this mod should slot in nicely immediately before or immediately after SCS... *except* the MRO: if you install aTweaks PnP fiends, the MRO component should be installed after that. (That's why I moved the MRO to the end as of v5.3.)  Alternatively, if you want really hard aTweaks fiends, you can install aTweaks after the MRO, and they will be the only creatures in the game that have magic resistance.</p>
  <p>My personal install order looks something like this:
  <ul>
    <li> [quest mods]</li>
    <li> [NPC mods]</li>
    <li> [item mods including Item Revisions]</li>
    <li> [spell mods including Spell Revisions]</li>
    <li> [small kit mods]</li>
    <li> Divine Remix</li>
    <li> Song & Silence</li>
    <li> Rogue Rebalancing</li>
    <li> Monastic Orders of Faerun</li>
    <li> Tome & Blood</li>
    <li> Faiths & Powers</li>
    <li> Might and Guile</li>
    <li> [tweak mods including Tweaks Anthology]</li>
    <li> Scales of Balance</li>
    <li> SCS</li>
    <li> [end-of-order mods like LevelOneNPCs, NPC_EE, Randomiser, etc.]</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Modder Resources:</strong><br />
	Scales of Balance adds several custom spellstates to SPLSTATE.IDS.  It uses the 4th byte of stat 115, Clubs proficiency, for certain features, principally the Revised Weapon Styles component. </p>

  <h4 class="subheader">Component 100: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Item & Weapon Overhaul (IWO): Yet Another Revised Armor System</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component changes armor to give the wearer a mix of Armor Class and Damage Resistance bonuses. The values are listed below:</p>
      <pre>
 Armor:
    leather:	  AC 8 	-1 Dex 	8% DR 	+2 casting time  +0 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty
    studded:	  AC 7 	-2 Dex 	12% DR 	+2 casting time  +0 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty
    hide armor:   AC 6 	-3 Dex 	24% DR	+3 casting time  +0 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty
    chain mail:   AC 5 	-3 Dex 	24% DR	+3 casting time  +1 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty
    splint mail:  AC 5 	-4 Dex 	30% DR	+4 casting time  +2 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty
    plate mail:   AC 4 	-5 Dex 	36% DR	+5 casting time  +2 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty
    full plate:   AC 3 	-4 Dex	42% DR	+5 casting time  +2 weapon speed  0% miscast chance  0 movement penalty<br />
 Enchantment:
    +1:	 	-1 AC	+1 Dex	+1% DR
    +2: 	-2 AC 	   " 	+2% DR
    +3:		-3 AC 	   " 	+3% DR
    +4:		-4 AC 	   " 	+4% DR
    +5:		-5 AC 	   " 	+5% DR
    +6:		-6 AC 	   " 	+6% DR<br />
  * "Caster" armors: no casting speed penalty
  * Elven armors: dex/casting speed equal to leather
  * Scale armors: like plate mail for AC, like chain for DR and penalties
      </pre>
    <p>This component allows casting arcane spells in armor, but with steep casting time penalties. (As of now, these penalties do not affect divine casters.) It also makes changes to Dexterity bonuses: bonuses to AC and thieving skills are increased so that the penalty for wearing armor is more meaningful without being crippling, and the option to go without armor is a bit more reasonable.</p>
    <p>This also makes changes to Dexterity bonuses: bonuses to AC and thieving skills are increased so that the penalty for wearing armor is more meaningful without being crippling, and the option to go without armor is a bit more reasonable.</p>
    <p>Finally, this alters the Armor of Faith spell to only give a flat 10% DR bonus, at all levels; and reduces the DR bonus from Hardiness and Defensive Stance form 40% to 20%; and reduces the price of the Defender of Easthaven while reducing its DR bonus from 20% to 5%.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE:</b> you can change these values by editing them in /Scales_of_Balance/ini/YARAS_default.ini. As of version 5.33, there is another version of these settings, which only applies thief skill penalties a chance of miscast magic... this is meant to mimic the "Allow Thieving in Heavy Armor" and "Allow Spellcasting in Armor" components of Tweaks Anthology, but is compatible with mods like Might & Guile and the 5E spellcasting conversion. To use those settings or your own personal preferences, copy /Scales_of_Balance/ini/YARAS_CD.ini or your modified version of /Scales_of_Balance/ini/YARAS_default.ini into your override folder and rename it to "d5_yaras.ini." If that file is in your override folder at the time of installation, the mod will use those settings instead of the default settings. You can keep a copy with your own preferred settings and use it each time you install mods.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the IR component "Revised Armors" as well as the "Spellcasting in Armor" component.  Ditto for the Full Plate and Packing Steel mod, and some armor/casting-related components of Tweaks Anthology and Klatu Tweaks. Don't install these things together; choose one armor system mod and stick with it.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 101: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO: Aesthetic & Enchantment Tweaks</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component removes "+1," "+2," etc. from item names, and standardizes the enchantment levels of weapons for purposes of which enemies they can hit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Generic +1 weapons become "Mastercraft" weapons, forged with unusual materials and skill that enable them to strike enemies who are immune to normal weapons.</li>
      <li> Generic +2 and +3 weapons become "Enchanted" weapons, with the enchantment level and stats of +2 weapons.</li>
      <li> All named weapons that were formerly from +1 to +4, become +3 weapons for purposes of what they can hit - though their bonuses and magical abilities remain unchanged.</li>
      <li> All upgraded weapons and originally +5/+6 weapons become +5 for purposes of what they can hit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>New in version 5.14 is an optional "hardcore" version of this component, borrowed from the "Low Magic World" mod.  In this version all generic enchanted weapons, instead of being standardized as +2, are turned into "mastercraft" weapons (i.e. equivalent to +1).</p>
    <p>(This component does not work on IWDEE - too many items are defined and recognized by the "plus" in their names and descriptions.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the SCS component "Make +1 Weapons Into Fine Weapons." This component also has other effects, of course. You should not install that component of SCS if you want to use this component.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 102: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO: Functional Weapon Tweaks</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component makes tweaks to the base characteristics of various items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Spears do 2d4 damage, since in BG games they are of the 2-handed variety (this is per PnP).</li>
      <li> Quarterstaves get an inherent -1 AC bonus.</li>
      <li> Daggers do 1d5 base damage instead of 1d4. (This includes throwing daggers.)</li>
      <li> Light crossbows can be used 1-handed, with shields. Heavy crossbows have an overall +3 damage bonus to compensate.</li>
      <li> Bolts do 1d6 base damage (and thus, from heavy crossbows they do 1d6+3).</li>
      <li> Bows have their base APR reduced to 3/2; Longbows and composite bows do an extra +2 damage.</li>
      <li> Arrows do 1d5 damage (and thus, 1d5+2 from longbows).</li>
      <li> Sling bullets do blunt damage.</li>
      <li> Darts have 2 APR instead of 3.</li>
      <li> In the EE games, strength damage bonuses are removed from thrown daggers, darts, and slings.</li>
      <li> Archers (and any kits with the Archer usability flag) can now use Elven Chain armor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers some of the same ground as the "Weapon Changes" component of Item Revisions. I, for one, use both together. But be aware that this might compound or override some of the IR component's effects.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 103: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO: Distinctions between Light and Heavy Weapons</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>NOTE: This component is deprecated and will no longer be installed.  Distinctions between light and heavy weapons when dual-wielding are included in a much more comprehensive way in component #124, the "Fighting Style Overhaul."</em></strong></p>
    <p>Light, low-damage weapons get a +1 off-hand thac0 bonus.  These weapons include short swords, and daggers.  Light two-handed weapons - spears and quarterstaves - get an overall +1 thac0 bonus.</p>
    <p>Heavy weapons that are inappropriate for dual-wielding get a -2 penalty to off-hand thac0. These include bastard swords, katanas, and flails.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the "Dual-Wielding Changes for Light and Heavy Weapons" component of Item Revisions. You can probably use both together, but the effects will be compounded and will likely be somewhat extreme. Best to choose one or the other.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 104: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO: IWDEE-specific Item Tweaks</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component patches IWDEE items in several different ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Weapons for sale by Conlan have their prices normalized a bit.</li>
      <li> The Black Knight and White Bishop figurines are usable once per day instead of once ever.</li>
      <li> Melee weapons "of Action" are changed a bit: instead of giving bonus APR, they *set* base APR higher.</li>
      <li> Weapons "of Action" +2 that previously only gave +1 DEX now give an extra 1/2 APR as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 109: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>IWO: Universal Potions</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component removes the usability restrictions from potions, since I don't understand how one's choice of profession can affect the ability to drink certain liquids.</p>
    <p>So now you can waste a potion of Giant Strength on your mage; and you can boost your barbarian's pickpocket skills with a Potion of Thievery. Go crazy.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 122 (for EE 1.4+): </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Weapon Proficiency Overhaul (WPO): Overall Overhaul</em></strong></p>
      <p><b>INSTALL NOTE:</b> if you install this component, then component #121 (Weapon Category Combination) will also be installed automatically. </p>
      <p>This component can be considered a convenience tweak; it will give most classes natably more proficiency points to spend. But it incentivizes spreading those points more widely instead of focusing on a single weapon (like the vanilla game), and your overall level of power at any given moment should roughly on par with an unmodded game. The aim is, with more points in more weapons, when you complete a quest and find a wonderful magical artifact, you can actually *use* it instead of just tossing it into your pack to sell later.</p>
      <p>Weapon use is slightly liberalized: all weapons are usable by clerics, but single-class clerics can only be proficient in traditional cleric weapons (the exception being kitted clerics' favored weapons.) Multiclass clerics primarily benefit from this: cleric/thieves can use thief weapons, and fighter/clerics can use any weapon.</p>
      <p>Clubs are truly universal, simple weapons: everyone can use them. Crossbows are usable by everyone except druids and Beastmasters.</p>
      <p>Warriors, rogues, and priests start with 5 proficiency points; wizards, sorcerers, and shamans start with 3. Warriors receive up the 3 more proficiencies, chosen by dialogue, if their INT score is 11 (+1), 12 (+2), or 13 (+3).  At 1st level, nonwarriors may only put one point in any weapon or style, so you must spread those proficiencies among many weapons. Warriors may specialize at 1st level. </p>
      <p>Warriors gain another proficiency point every 3 levels. Rogues gain a new point every 4 levels. Druids, clerics and shamans gain a new point every 5 levels. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks can never move past their initial proficiencies (<b>NOTE</b> - this means no more weapon advancement <b>at all</b> after dual-classing into a mage!).</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Trueclass fighters and Kensai can attain Mastery (+++) at 6th level, and High Mastery (++++) at 9th level, in any weapons they focus on.</li>
        <li> Other kitted fighters plus barbarians, paladins, rangers, and multiclass fighters can attain Mastery (+++) at 6th level.</li>
        <li> Rogues, clerics and druids, as well as mage/thieves, cleric/thieves and cleric/mages, can attain Specialization (++) after 6th level, with any weapons they can normally use.</li>
        <li> Multiclass fighter/mages can attain Mastery (+++) in any weapon but the only available styles are Single-Weapon and Two-Handed Weapon. </li>
        <li> Fighter/clerics and Fighter/thieves can attain Mastery (+++) in any weapon they can use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beyond that, certain kits will be able to reach 1 point higher or lower in certain weapons (e.g. Archers can reach (++++) with missile weapons, and only (++) with melee weapons; Assassins can reach (+++) with daggers; etc.). </p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Proficiency benefits (cumulative totals)<br />
        &ndash; ** = +1 thac0; +1 damage; +0.5 APR<br />
        &ndash; *** = +3 thac0; +2 damage; +1 APR<br />
        &ndash; **** = +4 thac0; +4 damage; +1.5 APR<br />.</p>
      </div>
      <p>At 12th level, warriors will get a +1/2 APR bonus with all weapons. (This is in place of the unmodded game's 1/2 APR bonuses at 7th and 13th levels. Because you can get an extra APR bonus from proficiencies, the late-game total max APR for warriors will end up the same as in the unmodded game.)
      <p>(The APR bonuses will only benefit warriors, unless you also install the WPO part 5, "APR on Spec.")
      <p>This component also tweaks the thac0 tables: Rogues' thac0 becomes equal to clerics and their progression is smoothed out - no more jumping by 2.</p>

    <p>This component makes serious changes and it has been rather hard to get various game mechanisms to work with it, especially dual-classing and NPCs. To catch them up, joinable NPCs will have several innate abilities that allow you to choose more proficiencies for them.</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component is generally not compatible with stuff like the weapon proficiency changes in Tweaks Anthology. Choose one proficiency system mod and stick with it.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 123: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO: Expanded Combat Skills System</em></strong></p>
      <p><b>INSTALL NOTE:</b> if you choose to install this component, then you cannot install component #121 (Weapon Category Combination). This component already folds in a handful of combined categories - though not as many as that component. </p>
      <p>This component is an <b>alternative</b> to component #121 the older revised Proficiencies. This system is more conservative in some ways: it does not combine as many weapon groups together, and it does not alter other systems like thac0 advancement or weapon styles. However it adds a lot of new abilities. Its chief aim is to expand the definition of "proficiency" and the options for how players develop their combat skills. It folds in a number of 3E-style feats borrowed from the Might & Guile mod, and uses a single currency - proficiency points - to manage both weapon skill and feats.</p>
      <p>First off, this system folds a few weapon categories together:
      <ul>
        <li> Long swords and bastard swords are combined.</li>
        <li> Clubs and Maces are combined.</li>
        <li> Spears and halberds are combined.</li>
        <li> Daggers and darts are combined.</li>
        <li> Long bows and short bows are combined.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Second, this streamlines the number of proficiencies you can put into a weapon:
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Proficiency benefits (cumulative totals)<br />
        &ndash; ** = +2 thac0; +1 damage<br />
        &ndash; *** = +3 thac0; +3 damage<br />
        &ndash; **** = +3 thac0; +3 damage, +.5 APR<br />.</p>
      </div>
    <p>Third, it introduces six new impovable combat skills that act similar to weapon styles:
      <ul>
        <li> The <b>Attack Speed</b> skill improves weapon speed with one rank, and increase APR by 0.5 with each subsequent rank. Warriors may take four ranks in this proficiency; most non-warriors may take two. (<b>NOTE:</b> in this system there are no automatic APR bonuses for reaching certain levels, or from being specialized with a weapon. The only ways to increase APR is to invest in this proficiency, and to reach the fourth and final pip with weapon proficiencies. So do not neglect this!)</li>
        <li> The <b>Dodge</b> skill grants a 1-point bonus to armor class with each rank. Most character may take two ranks in this proficiency; Swashbucklers may take up to six. (And this replaces Swashbucklers' automatic level-based AC bonus.)</li>
        <li> The <b>Backstab</b> skill applies a 1-point bonus to a character's backstab damage multiplier. Most thieves can take four ranks in this proficiency; Assassins can take six; Shadowdancers and Stalkers can take two. (And this replaces thieves' automatic level-based bonuses to backstab multiplier.)</li>
        <li> The <b>Set Snares</b> skill allows a character to set one snare per day, for each rank taken. Bounty Hunters can set one normal snare and one special snare for each rank taken. (And this replaces thieves' automatic level-based Set Snare ability.)</li>
        <li> The <b>Ranged Accuracy</b> skill grants a 1-point bonus to attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons, for each rank taken. Most characters can take up to two ranks in this proficiency; Archers can take six. (And this replaces Archers' automatic level-based bonuses.)</li>
        <li> The <b>Hurled Weapons</b> skill makes a character more likely to successfully strike enemies with thrown weapons like daggers and axes. A baseline 3-point penalty to ranged attack rolls is applied to these weapons; one rank in this proficiency reduces  that to a -1 penalty, and a second rank results in a 1-point bonus to attack. Halflings automatically begin the game with two ranks in this proficiency.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Fourth, this component introduces four more groups of feats that characters can learn. Each of these is tied to a single proficiency; each point spent on that proficiency grants an innate spell which, when cast, triggers a dialogue and allows the character to choose one feat from the group. These groups of feats are:</p>
    <p><b>Combat Postures:</b> these abilities represent the style and approach a character uses in combat. These are exclusive to each other - a character can only use one at any given time. But characters can learn more than one posture, and switch between them as it is convenient. 
      <ul>
        <li> Leadership: when in this posture all nearby allies gain a 1-point bonus to attack rolls, armoor class, and casting speed.</li>
        <li> Grappling: when using this approach, in addition to attacking the character will attempt to grab and hold a nearby enemy. Each round a nearby enemy must save vs. breath weapon or have their movement restricted for 3 seconds and be slowed for 6 seconds. If this occurs, the grappling character will also have their movement restricted for 3 seconds.</li>
        <li> Precise Strike: when in this posture, a character focuses on delivering penetrating attacks, and is thereby 5% more likely to land a critical hit.</li>
        <li> Parry Slashing: in this posture a character can block one otherwise-successful attack per round of this damage type. (Elemental damage attached to the attack will still affect the character, however.)</li>
        <li> Parry Piercing: in this posture a character can block one otherwise-successful attack per round of this damage type. (Elemental damage attached to the attack will still affect the character, however.)</li>
        <li> Parry Crushing: in this posture a character can block one otherwise-successful attack per round of this damage type. (Elemental damage attached to the attack will still affect the character, however.)</li>
        <li> Missil Snaring: in this posture a character can block one otherwise-successful missile attack each round. (Elemental damage attached to the attack will still affect the character, however.)</li>
        <li> Fighting Dirty: this character attempts to use dirty tricks to gain advantage over enemies. Each successful attack will for the target to save vs. breath weapon or be briefly blinded, tripped, or weakened.</li>
        <li> Spell Evasion: when in this posture a character can make an extra save vs. breath weapon in order to evade the effects of certain targeted and wide-area spells, such as Magic Missile and Fireball.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Physical Fitness:</b> These are ways a character can improve their physical capabilities.
      <ul>
        <li> Health Conditioning: this permanently grants the character 7 extra hit points.</li>
        <li> Toughness: this grants the character 10% resistance to slashing, piercing, and crushing damage.</li>
        <li> Resistance: this grants the character 10% resistance to fire, cold, and electric damage.</li>
        <li> Quickstride: this allows the character to move faster, or to toggle the ability off and move at the same speed as the rest of the party. (The exact bonus to movement speed can be controlled by a settings file in the "ini" subfolder.)</li>
        <li> Intestinal Fortitude: this allows the character an extra chance to save vs. death/poison to avoid the effects of any disease or poison to which they are exposed.</li>
        <li> Unflagging Determination: this allows the character an extra chance to save vs. petrification to avoid sleep, paralysis, fear, and stunning effects.</li>
        <li> Strength Training: this grants the character a permanent +1 bonus to Strength.</li>
        <li> Agility Training: this grants the character a permanent +1 bonus to Dexterity.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Miscellaneous Feats:</b> these are an assortment of generally roguish abilities that may be helpful in a pinch. 
      <ul>
        <li> Lore: this increases the character's Lore stat by 25 points.</li>
        <li> Tracking: this allows the at-will use of the Tracking ability, which can identify the general types of enemies nearby, and which direction they are in.</li>
        <li> Flaming Weapon: this skill enables the character to coat a weapon with viscous oil and light it aflame, thereby doing extra fire damage with successful attacks. The flame lasts for 2 turns, and the character can craft enough of the oil to use the ability once per day.</li>
        <li> Grease Jar/Smoke Bomb: this allows a character to create improvised semi-explosive devices which can cover a small area with slippery grease, or with noxious smoke. These mimic the effects of the wizard spells Grease and Stinking Cloud, respectively. Each device can be created and used once pr day.</li>
        <li> Escape Artist: this ability is the result of a character learning to untie knots, dodge tangling briars and webs, and generally escape when bound. Whenever the character is physically or magically restrained, there is a 50% chance each round that this character will be able to free themselves.</li>
        <li> Slippery Mind: this allows the character an extra chance to save vs. spells to avoid charm, domination, confusion, feeblemind, and maze effects.</li>
        <li> Luck: this grants a permanent 1-point bonus to a character's Luck. This can make the character slightly more likely to succeed with thieving skills and weapon attacks, and to take a bit less damage from enemy spell attacks.</li>
        <li> Wild Talent: this ability instantly grants a character the use of a psionic power, which is chosen at random. (NOTE, this ability will only be present if the 'Will to Power' psionics mod is installed.)</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Magical Abilities:</b> smart rogues can sometimes learn the basic tenets of magic, without studying enough to become a proper mage. They can learn to Use Magical Devices, a.k.a. cast spells from wands and scrolls. Additionally, they can learn some select low-level magic spells, generally those associated with illusions and hiding. Each time a character learns a spell this way they gain one 'spell slot,' which can be used to cast any spell they know (similar to how sorcerers cast spells). Shadowdancers automatically know the Shadowstep spell, and get two extra spell slots. The spells that can be learned this way include:
      <ul>
        <li> Color Spray</li>
        <li> Reflected Image</li>
        <li> Blur</li>
        <li> Knock</li>
        <li> Luck</li>
        <li> Glitterdust</li>
        <li> Sanctuary</li>
        <li> Shadowstep</li>
      </ul>
    <p>In order to make use of all these abilities, most characters get more proficiency points to spend. Most of these are available to warriors and rogues; bards and priests can use a few, while mages and sorcerers cannot use any. The number of proficiency points available to character is increased over the base game:
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>&ndash; Fighters/thieves: 8 at 1st level, plus 1 every two levels thereafter<br />
        &ndash; Rangers/Paladins: 6 at 1st level, plus 1 every two levels thereafter<br />
        &ndash; Priests/Bards/Monks: 5 at 1st level, plus 1 every three levels thereafter<br />
        &ndash; Mages/Sorcerers: 3 at 1st level, no more thereafter<br />.</p>
      </div>
    Additionally the maximum number of points that can be invested in any one proficiency is as follows:

  <h4 class="subheader">Component 124 (for EE 1.4+): </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO: Fighting Style Overhaul</em></strong></p>
      <p><b>INSTALL NOTE:</b> if you choose to install component #122, the Weapon Proficiency Overhaul, then this component will also be installed automatically. </p>
      <p>This component rebalances fighting styles in order to make them each more distinct and useful (instead of everything playing 2nd-fiddle to dual-wielding).  The benefits of each style are listed below:</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>Single-Weapon Style: now called <b>"Fencing"</b><br />
        &ndash; (+) = +1 thac0, -2 to weapon speed, +2 to saves vs. Breath Weapon<br />
        &ndash; (++) = APR increased by .5<br /></p>
        <p>Sword & Shield Style: now called <b>"Shield-Fighting"</b><br />
        &ndash; (+) = -1 melee AC bonus, -2 missile AC bonus<br />
        &ndash; (++) = may perform a shield bash once per round (1d3 damage per 5 levels and knockdown on failed save vs. Breath)<br /></p>
        <p>Two-Handed Weapon Style: now called <b>"Two-Hand Style"</b><br />
        &ndash; (+) = +1 thac0, +2 damage, +5% crit chance<br />
        &ndash; (++) = additional +1 thac0, +2 damage, and +5% crit chance<br /></p>
        <p>Two-Weapon Style: now called <b>"Dual-Wielding"</b><br />
        &ndash; ( ) = No off-hand attacks, no bonuses for dual-wielding<br />
        &ndash; (+) = 0 to 2 point melee AC bonus; off-hand attack with 6-point thac0 penalty compared to main hand<br />
        &ndash; (++) = off-hand attack with same thac0 penalty as main hand (see below)<br />.</p>
      </div> 
      <p>When dual-wielding, your main-hand thac0 will depend on the size and weight of the weapons you have equipped, as described below.</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
      	<p><b>&ndash; wielding two daggers:</b> 1-point thac0 penalty, 2-point melee AC bonus.<br />
      	<b>&ndash; dagger + anything:</b> 2-point thac0 penalty, 2-point AC bonus.<br />
      	<b>&ndash; medium + medium:</b> 2-point thac0 penalty, 1-point AC bonus.<br />
      	<b>&ndash; large + medium:</b> 3-point thac0 penalty, no AC bonus.<br />
      	<b>&ndash; large + large:</b> 4-point thac0 penalty, no AC bonus.<br />.</p>
      </div> 
      <p><b>Medium weapons are:</b> short sword, ninjato, wakizashi, club, war hammmer, mace, morning star.<br />
      <b>Large weapons are:</b> long sword, scimitar, bastard sword, katana, flail, battle axe.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> bastard swords and katanas are unusually large; they cannot be equipped in the off-hand position.</p>
      <p><b>Also note:</b> your thac0 and/or AC may briefly be incorrect when you equip two weapons and begin dual-wielding them. If your thac0 seems wrong, the first thing you should try it simply waiting a couple seconds with the game clock running. They should quickly resolve to the proper numbers.</p>
      <p><b>Shield bash:</b> in addition to the knockdown effect, it stuns opponents for 1 second starting at level 5; and the saving throw is at a -1 penalty for each 5 levels, up to level 20.</p>
      <p><b>Thrown daggers and darts:</b> will have their base APR reduced from 2 to 1.5, and from 3 to 2.5, respectively.  So you will need to be specialized in Fencing/SWS to get the full benefit of those items.</p>
      <p><b>OPTION:</b> by editing Scales_of_Balance/ini/styles.ini, you can set Two-Handed Weapon Style to match Single Weapon Style (it is a single weapon, after all) in granting extra APR for specialization, instead of extra damage and crit chance.</p>
      <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component covers the same ground as the "Dual-Wielding Changes for Light and Heavy Weapons" component of Item Revisions. You can probably use both together, but the effects will be compounded and will likely be somewhat extreme. Best to choose one or the other.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 125 (for EE 1.4+): </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>WPO: APR on Spec</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component enables any class to gain APR benefits from weapon specialization - not just warriors.</p>
      <p>(NB if you install component 122 without this one, only warriors will get the benefit of the APR bonus for basic proficiency.)</p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this component is not compatible with the APR on Spec component of Tweaks Anthology (which I wrote, and is based on this one). The other version is specifically designed for the vanilla proficiency system; this one is specifically designed for the WPO proficiency system. Use If you installed the "WPO Part 2," use this version.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 160: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Saving Throw Overhaul (STO)</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component changes all spells such that the saving throws they offer target follow these guidelines:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Direct magical and mental effects like Charms and Illusions offer saves vs. Spells. This includes spells like Blindness and Confusion.</li>
      <li>Area effects and physical that can be dodged offer saves vs. Breath Weapon. This includes spells like Fireball, Web, and Entangle.</li>
      <li>Necromantic effects and those that affect the subject's life and health offer saves vs. Poison/Death. This includes all Necromancy effects (including vampire Level Drain), fog spells like Cloudkill, and all poisons.</li>
      <li>Spells that affect the subject's physical form or movement offer saves vs. Petrification/Polymorph. This includes spells like Flesh to Stone and Polymorph Other, as well as Hold and Slow.</li>
      <li>Saving throws vs. Rod/Staff/Wands are basically unused. (If you install psionics from Might & Guile, psionic powers will use saves vs. Wands.)</li>
    </ul></p> 
    <p>Additionally, saving throw tables are made more sensible.  No earth-shaking changes, just sensible progression: wizards save well against spells, priests save well against death, rogues save well against breath, and warriors save well against almost everything.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 170 (for EE 1.4+): </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>STO: IWD-Style Spell Evasion</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component adds the IWD Evasion skill (which I'll generally refer to as "Spell Evasion" to distinguish it from the BG2 HLA). This allows thieves of 7th level or higher to roll a saving throw vs. Breath Weapon for a chance to completely dodge the effects of certain spells like Fireball, Skull Trap, Holy Smite, etc.</p>
      <p>You can choose to install it with the bare list of spells that can be evaded in IWDEE, or with an expanded list that includes things like BG2 HLAs and some other spells that I think make sense, like Magic Missile, Acid Arrow, Web, and others. Basically anything that seems like it could be dodged by a skilled rogue in the game world. This should gives thieves a distinctive and unique defensive advantage, something they sorely lack in the vanilla game.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> this component can only be installed on EE games with the 2.0 or later patch. </p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 200 (for EE 1.4+): </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Stat Bonus Overhaul (SBO)</em></strong></p>
    <p>To make more meaningful differences between races, demihumans will have more stat bonuses and penalties.  The racial maximums are now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Elves: 19 Dex, 19 Int, 17 Str, 16 Con</li>
        <li> Half-elf: 19 Cha, 17 Wis</li>
        <li> Dwarf: 19 Con, 17 Dex, 17 Cha</li>
        <li> Halfling: 19 Dex, 19 Cha, 17 Int, 16 Str</li>
        <li> Gnome: 19 Int, 19 Con, 17 Str, 16 Wis</li>
        <li> Half-orc: 19 Str, 17 Int, 16 Cha</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This component shifts saving throw bonuses to the INT, WIS, and CHA stats. Therefore, and since Constitution is already one of the most important stats in the game, the "shorty save bonuses" for high CON are eradicated.  In their place, dwarves and halflings get a flat +3 bonus to saves vs. Death/Poison, and gnomes get a flat +2 bonus to saves vs. Spells.</p>
    <p>Finally, the major effect of this component: stat bonuses are modified so that every point added above 13 or so results in a tangible benefit; and scores below ~11 have some tangible penalties (down to 5, which is the new minimum).  <b>NOTE:</b> the changes for each stat can be selectively skipped by editing a variable in /Scales_of_Balance/ini/stats.ini.<br />

      <p>Note: the 18/xx "exceptional" Strength doesn't work in BG like it does in PnP; ALL bonuses are supposed to go up that table in steps (including for non-warriors). BG makes it so that the 1-point jump from 18 to 19 is a bigger difference than the <strong>5-point</strong> jump from 13 to 18. I fix that by, essentially, collapsing the 18/xx values to all be about the same. Bonuses are pushed downward, so there is now almost the same difference between 14 and 15 as there is between 18 and 19.</p>

    <p><strong><em>SBO: Ability Score Bonus Spells for 5E-Style Casting</em></strong></p>
      <p>These components are only available if component 201 is installed. They represent options for how the ability score-based bonus spells should operate if the '5E Spellcasting' mod is installed, or a mod that uses it such as Tome & Blood's Arcanist or Might & Guile's Revised bards. With only component 201, those spellcasters will get bonus memorization slots, but no bonus casting slots. These components allow you to change that: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Component 2012:</b> ability score bonuses increase <i>both</i> memorization slots and casting slots. <br />
      <li><b>Component 2013:</b> ability score bonuses increase casting slots but do <i>not</i> increase memorization slots. </p>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: if you combine component 2012 this with the component in the 5E casting mod that grants bonus casting slots for the Ring of Wizardry and similar magical items, you will end up with a <b>LOT</b> of both memorization and casting slots. I'm surprised to hear myself say this, but it is too many. With such bonuses a 5E mage can easily overpower a sorcerer, which is not supposed to happen. In particular, large numbers of <i>memorization</i> slots can unbalance things; 5E casters can change out their prepared spells every day, so limits on ho many spells they can have prepared is a key balancing mechanism. My suggestion for finding a happy medium is to skip the 5E items component, thereby setting magic items to only increase memorization slots; and to install component 2013 here, thereby setting stat bonuses to only increase casting slots. (Or, if you really want a lot of casting slots, install the 5E items component with component 2013 - that will give you lots of casting slots but retain some limits on memorization slots.)</p>

    <p><strong><em>SBO: Full Strength from 2-Hand Weapons Only</em></strong></p>
      <p>This small component simply adds a -1 STR penalty to every 1-handed weapon.  The idea behind it is, your "STR" score measures your total bodily strength. If you attempt a feat of strength one-handed, naturally the result will not be as effective as if you used both arms. </p>
      <p>Note: this penalty stacks, so you will have a -2 penalty when dual-wielding. That weapon style is all about speed - not power! </p>

  <h4 class="subheader">Component 204 (for EE 2.0+): </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>SBO: Concentration Checks</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component enables the 'concentration' stat and allows spellcasters to roll to avoid interruption when they take damage during casting. The formula is:</p>
      <p><i>(1d20 + Luck) vs. (spell level + damage taken)</i></p>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> This is disabled for now. I've heard it said that concentration checks are bugged in the EE 2.0-2.5 engine, applying the 'damage taken' value on the wrong side of the equation:</p>
      <p><i>(1d20 + Luck + damage taken) vs. (spell level)</i></p>
      <p>This means that the more damage you take, the more likely you are to avoid spell interruption. That is really stupid, and it really annoys me that Beamdog has let this bug persist through several patches. I don't think they fixed it for 2.5 (someone with more time than me can run some tests, if you like), and who knows what they're doing for the new 2.6 patch - I don't even know how to report bugs for it. Hopefully they get off their butts and fix this, because it is one of the last places in the engine where the old engine with ToBEx is completely superior. It's 2020 guys, that shouldn't be happening anymore.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 205: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Hit Dice Overhaul (HDO): Revised Hit Point Progression</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component takes some of the randomness out of hit point rolls. In the vanilla system, a warrior with 16 CON can actually get *fewer* hit points at level-up than a mage with 8 CON. That only leads to annoying reloads or constant moving of the difficulty bar to get max hp (which is just too cheaty, and perverts various game mechanics). With this component, there are still rolls, but the roll will usually seem "fair" and should never cause you to feel you need to reload or go below Core difficulty. That 16 CON warrior will get between 9 and 12 hit points per level, instead of from 3 to 12. Higher average rolls, and more satisfying numbers, but not overpowered.<br />
      <ul>
      	<li>Wizard hit dice is now 1d3+1. Rogue and priest hit dice is 2d3+1. And warrior hit dice is 3d3+1 (3d4+1 for barbarians).</li>
      	<li>Everyone gets an extra hit point at 14 CON and 16 CON, and warriors get an extra hit point at 18 CON.  Everyone also gets an extra hit point at 20, 22, and 24 CON (so stat-boosting spells and effects can actually increase non-warriors' hit points).</li>
      	<li>The minimum roll for those d3 rolls is 2 at 15 CON, and 3 at 17 CON. (So 17 CON means max hit points.)</li>
      	<li>Everyone gets very slow hit point regeneration (1 hp per 2 turns) at 19 CON. The regeneration speeds up a bit at 20 CON (1 per turn), 21 CON (1 per 4 rounds), 22 CON (1 per 2 rounds), 23 CON (1 per round), 24 CON (2 per round), and 25 CON (1 per second).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This slightly front-loads HD progression: you get about 2HD at first level, but HD only goes to 7th level (so you get 8HD total). From 8th level on::
      <ul>
      	<li>Warriors get 4/level from 8 to 15, then 3/level from 16 to 25, and 2/level after that. </li>
      	<li>Rogues and priests get 3/level from 8 to 15, 2/level from 16 to 25, and 1 per level after that. </li>
      	<li>Wizards get 2/level from 8 to 15, and 1/level after that. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, there is an alternate hardcore version of this component, which eliminates 1 hp from each class (so wizards are 1d3, rogues/priests are 2d3, and warriors are 3d3). The regular component should give hit points somewhere between the vanilla game's mean and max values; the hardcore variant should result in hit points closer to vanilla's mean. </p>
      <p>Finally, there is a third version of the Hit Dice progression, labeled "Reduced." This is unrelated to the system described above; it is a simpler modification for players who want to retain the original game's mechanic and who tend to play with the "max hit point rolls" option, but who do not want monstrous amounts of hit points. This option reduces wizard hit dice to 1d3, rogues to 1d4, priests to 1d5, warriors to 1d6, and barbarians to 1d7. It also gives +1 hit point per level for every even point of CON starting at 12 for warriors, and at 14 for non-warriors. If you use the "max hit point rolls" game option, this should approximate higher-than-average rolls in the original system, but with zero variability. Like the other two components, it doubles the hit die at 1st level, but unlike them it allows hit dice rolls until 9th level. After that you only get 2-3 hp/level, slowly tapering to just 1 hp/level at level 25.</p>

  <h4 class="subheader">Component 210: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Experience Point Overhaul (XPO): Revised Tables</em></strong></p>
      <p>XP advancement and thac0/spell/skill advancement are two ends of the same rope; you only need to pull on one end to get the desired effect, but for some reason the 2e rules pull both. I've streamlined it to a fast path and a slow path. Fighters, thieves, bards, and clerics are on the faster table; paladins, rangers, druids and wizards are on the slower table. (No more thieves with more hp than fighters with the same XP!) Advancement is a bit faster than vanilla in the middle levels, and then gets progressively slower at epic levels. You'll be at or near level 20 with 3 million XP, like in vanilla; but won't hit level 30 until 8 million XP. HLAs will be rarer with this component, so choose wisely!</p>
      <p>The unmodded game sets HLAs to be available at certain levels based on when each class hits 3 million XP. Because these new XP tables change that, the mod will also change when you get HLAs for the sake of uniformity and convenience, all classes will get HLAas when you achieve "epic levels," i.e. level 21. <b>NOTE</b> this is true for multiclasses too! No more getting HLAs at 13th level or whatever, instead multiclasses wil get HLAs starting at level 20, when they have close to 6 million XP. Multiclassing will just have to be, like virtue, its own reward. :P </p>
      <p>This component also switches the druid spellcasting table to match the priest one (since the PnP druid XP and spell tables were only for Grand/Hierophant Druids who settle down in a grove and stop adventuring).</p>

  <h4 class="subheader">Component 212: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>XPO: No Murder XP</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component very simply divides the XP reward for killing creatures by 2, 5, or 10.  The aim is to make quest XP derived from role-playing relatively more important, compared to combat experience. Quest XP is not changed at all; so this component will result in a substantial reduction in total XP available over the course of the game.</p>
      <p>Do not install this unless you are looking for more of a challenge!</p>

    <p><strong><em>Experience Point Overhaul (XPO): Revised Starting XP in Siege of Dragonspear</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component gives you four choices for how much XP you will have if you begin a new campaign in Siege of Dragonspear: 
    <ul>
      <li>65,000</li>
      <li>90,000</li>
      <li>125,000</li>
      <li>161,000</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>This works in the standalone SoD games, in SoD campaigns when the expansion has been purchased for BGEE, and in EET games.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Components 226-229: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Experience Point Overhaul (XPO): Revised Starting XP in Shadows of Amn</em></strong></p>
    <p>This component gives you four choices for how much XP you will have if you begin a new campaign in BG2 Shadows of Amn: 
    <ul>
      <li>90,000</li>
      <li>161,000</li>
      <li>240,000</li>
      <li>400,000</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>This works in BG2EE, as well as in EET games. I have not tested it in the pre-EE engine, but if the game includes STARTARE.2DA, then this should work on TOB and BGT games.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 230: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Magic Resistance Overhaul (MRO): Eliminate MR</em></strong></p>
    <p>WARNING: This component makes very severe changes to the way the game works, and should be considered as 'beta' quality. Its purpose is to largely (but not completely) remove the probability-based "magic resistance" mechanic from the game. It makes the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All creatures in the game, such as drow, dragons, skeleton warriors, etc., will have their MR set to zero. Instead, they will receive +3 bonuses to saving throws vs. Breath, Petrification, and Wands, and a +6 bonus to saving throws vs. Spells. (No bonus to saves vs. Death - this should make necromancy magic a little stronger and more special.)</li>
      <li>Monks and Wizard Slayers will not get MR; instead, they will get a +1 bonus to all saving throws at level 1, and at every 4th level thereafter (5th, 9th, 13th, etc. up to 25th).</li>
      <li>Almost all items in the game that grant MR have been changed. Some, like the Amulet of Magic Resistance, have their MR converted into resistance to all elemental and magic damage. Others, like Carsomyr, instead get large bonuses to saving throws. Some are very different, like the Sword of Balduran which now grants a movement rate bonus.</li>
      <li>It is still possible to get *some* MR, from the Hell Trials and the Machine of Lum the Mad. That's okay, 15% MR isn't game-breaking... it only gets stupid when it is stacked to high levels.</li>
      <li>Likewise, the "Magic Resistance" spell is left untouched. It can be used as another form of magic protection along with the likes of Spell Deflections and Globes of Invulnerability. Lower Resistance, Pierce Magic, and Pierce Shield are still effective against this spell, and SCS enemies will use them against you.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><b>Compatibility:</b> this should be installed after all mods that add creatures and items that may be subject to magic resistance. Notably, if you want this to affect fiends (removing their MR), then this component should be installed after Spell Revisions, SCS, and aTweaks.</p>
